# Udacity Project 2 - Memory Game
These are the files for the second project in Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree.  All of the code was written by me (Jonathan Sexton) unless otherwise stated (snippets are credited in code base).

The live, playable game can be found [here](https://codepen.io/JS-goose/full/xjoZBZ/).

# Project Design
I wanted this game to have a beach theme without being too beach-like (shells, sand, etc.).  I opted for pastel colors and a font that, I think, accomplishes just what I was looking for.  I'd love to know what you think!

# Playing Locally
Fork a copy of the repo and then download the files to your local machine.  Once you have the files, simply open the folder and then open index.html in your favorite browser to start playing.

# Instructions
There are 16 total cards (8 pairs) that are randomly shuffled (as best can be with the algorithm) each time a new game starts.  Click the cards to reveal their symbol.  Once a match has been made, the background color will change to indicate a match.  The card will also be locked in the open position.  Each click is counted as a move, and depending on the amount of moves you have stars will disappear.  More clicks === less stars.  The timer begins on the first click.  

Once you have matched all 16 cards a modal popup will display congratulating you on your victory and displaying relevant game stats.

# Required Dependencies 
* [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for game icons (all free icons, no need to buy)

# Optional Dependencies 
* [Permanent Marker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker) font from Google Fonts (completely free)
The game will work without this font but I think it looks better with the font.
